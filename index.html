                            <p>An app entirely designed for nurses which will allow them to share their knowledge, experience, and thoughts in a confidential manner, and facilitate their communication. Moreover, nurses will be able to express their emotions and opinions in a supportive and understanding environment. </p>
                            <p class="desktop">The app will contain feedback from patients which is used to help nurses develop a better connection with their patients, improve their work skills, and motivate them in their future work. As a result nurses will feel more connected, less emotionally overwhelmed and ultimately more satisfied and productive.</p>
